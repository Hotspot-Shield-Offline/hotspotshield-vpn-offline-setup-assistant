# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The Hotspot Shield VPN Offline Setup Assistant is designed as a **local demonstration tool** with security in mind. Since this is an offline simulator that doesn't handle real VPN connections or sensitive user data, the security concerns are primarily around the local application integrity.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🐛 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly** at: `security@hotspot-shield-offline.com`
2. **Include the following information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

### 📅 Response Timeline
- **24 hours**: Initial response acknowledging receipt
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment of the vulnerability
- **7 days**: Detailed response with fix timeline
- **30 days**: Public disclosure (after fix is released)

## 🔍 Security Scope

### ✅ In Scope
- Local application security vulnerabilities
- UI injection or manipulation issues
- File system access vulnerabilities
- Code execution vulnerabilities
- Data exposure in offline mode

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Network security (app is offline-only)
- Third-party dependencies (unless critical)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access to user's machine
- Issues requiring physical access to the device

## 🛠️ Security Measures

### Application Security
- **No Network Activity**: App operates completely offline
- **No Data Collection**: No personal information stored or transmitted
- **Local File Access**: Minimal and controlled file system interaction
- **Sandboxed Operation**: Limited system permissions required

### Development Security
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed before merge
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- **Secure Build Process**: Automated builds with integrity verification
- **Version Control**: All changes tracked and signed

## 🔐 Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage
1. **Download from Official Sources**: Only use verified releases
2. **Verify Checksums**: Validate file integrity before installation
3. **Use Antivirus**: Keep your antivirus software updated
4. **Regular Updates**: Update to latest versions when available

### File Security
- Store downloaded files in secure directories
- Don't execute files from untrusted sources
- Use the official GitHub releases page

## 📜 Security Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- **No Telemetry**: Application doesn't send usage data
- **No Logging**: Minimal local logging, no sensitive data
- **Offline First**: Complete functionality without internet
- **Local Storage**: All data remains on user's device

### Transparency
- **Open Source**: All code is publicly auditable
- **MIT License**: Permissive licensing for security review
- **Community Driven**: Issues and fixes are public
- **Regular Updates**: Security patches released promptly
